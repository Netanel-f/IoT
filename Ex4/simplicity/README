Software design-architecture-flow description
---------------------------------------------
We have used MCU support of UART, USART and Capacitive touch sensor.
We have also managed to support screen line scroll to ease the user eyes.

-- Setup MCU needed modules.
-- Init GPS & MODEM serial connections (UART & USART)
-- Infinite loop which stop when user pushes a button
	-- BTN0: starting the procedure of sampling operators and checking
			 the signal quality.
			 Then, transmit HTTP POST request to requestbin.com with relavant info.
	-- BTN1: Initiate a speed limit program.
			 * Set speed limit using the capacative touch sensor.
			 * Sample device location every 5 seconds.
			 * Calculate speed of device (based on the last two location samples)
			 * If device's speed is greater then limit then send gps payload + 'highspeed=true'
			 * If device's speed was greater then limit and now the speed is lower then limit,
			   then send gps payload + 'highspeed=false'.
